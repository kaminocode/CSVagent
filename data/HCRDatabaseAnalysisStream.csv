Immediately prior to the gas release an Operator was draining down condensate from X01/X02 produced gas coolers into the closed drains system.,Quarrying (inc extraction of petroleum gas),CRUDE PETROLEUM,,"The FA plant was being re-started after a plant shutdown from the previous day. The FASP DGL compressor was started up, this causes slugs of condensate to fill V04/V05 suction scrubbers. An operator proceeded to drain down X01/X02 in order to clear this build-up of condensate. Shortly after this activity was commenced, the CRT noted a high pressure alarm in the closed drains. The operator then ceased draining down X01/X02. After some discussion, it was suspected that an ice plug had formed somewhere on the common line to V45 flare drum and condensate within the closed drains manifold was flashing off, causing the pressure to rise. In an attempt to clear the suspected ice plug, an operator routed warm water from the hydrocyclones to upstream of the suspected blockage via a hose. Low gas alarms were then registered on two gas detectors in the area where the FE pig receiver V602 is. The gas detectors did not reach the high alarm point and were not coincident. Two operators went to investigate the area around V602 and reported a smell of gas and the sound of gas escaping from a leak point. The decision was then made to manually activate a yellow shutdown at 23:47. The platform GPA was sounded and persons onboard went to muster. The gas detector readings dropped to zero and on investigation from the fire team there was no further signs of gas reported. A 20mm wide hole was found on the closed drains manifold where the FE pig receiver drain line ties in.

Summary provided below:

Operations:
� Site personnel were in compliance with the drilling program as written, minor approved amendments were authorized through appropriate process
� There was not sufficient warning of the event occurring to prevent the release, minor initial gas returns with reducing trend to zero before casing cutting commenced and;
� The flow check was extended from 15 mins to almost 30 mins after an initial 0.9 barrel increase was noted. This was interpreted as being due to a Utubing effect (11.1ppg mud in wellbore versus lighter fluid in annulus). The extended flow check period was static. The Drilling program stated to expect u-tubing
� The response was swift and effective in preventing potential escalation by undertaking a hard shut in at the Annular BOP. This was followed by pressure monitoring and recording by the rig crew

Planning:
� The abandonment planning was as per existing CNOOC procedures in terms of risk assessment (HIRA), well examiner submission / review and CNOOC programme sign off
� There are no CNOOC UK procedures providing detailed instruction on planning and execution of slot recovery activities
� The abandonment HIRA did not identify pressure or gas in the annulus as a risk following the seal assembly release. Although donor well data is collated and reviewed, the WDP does not list a deliverable specific to slot recoveries in order to ensure all hazards are identified through the full lifecycle of the slot
� The Annular BOP was closed during the 9 5/8� seal assembly release providing a secondary barrier but not during, or immediately after the casing cut. Preliminary recommendations to address the above findings include:
� Create a governing process for the planning and execution of Slot Recovery activities and integrate with the Well Delivery Process. This process must include content to address the findings made in this investigation.
� When planning future slot recovery operations, assess on a well by basis the requirement for surface fluids handling packages or a safe method of using platform production facilities to handle any encountered hydrocarbons
� Drilling Hazard Catalogue must be updated to capture slot recovery hazards, lessons learned and best practices
� Ensure B annulus samples taken and analysed prior to slot recovery operations
� Incorporate annuli information and sampling requirements into CNOOC Slot Recovery Procedure",,,,"A volume of gas was liberated from the B annulus during casing cutting operations.

The inability to vent pressure sufficiently meant that the returns line consequently applied pressure in the lines that function for the XT valves, opening them partially. ","In the immediacy - the hydraulic fluid (Transaqua) returns set-up has been modified to 'vent to tank' rather than 'vent to sea'. This has prevented inadvertent pressure being applied to the XT valves when operating other functions within the TRT.

Even though Pierce A-09 was killed in 2018, and had an inflow tested deep-set plug to prevent flow
of reservoir fluids to surface, a small amount of a residual gas volume was able to migrate from the
VXT through WCP to sea.
A combination of low wellhead pressure, low cracking pressure of VXT valves and WCP XT Control
return line hydraulic pressure is the main reason for the unintended operation of the VXT valves.
The TIOS investigation found that hydraulic pressure was able to build-up on the return side of the
WCP XT connector chamber & in the common return line system within the WCP XT control module
sufficiently enough to overcome the cracking pressure of the closed XT valves.
Furthermore, it has been determined that the cracking pressure for the XT valves was not included in
the TFMC Interface Data Sheet (IDS) during the upfront planning stages of the work.

A fabric maintenance acitvity to remove a deck penetration was ongoing adjacent to the location of the release.,Quarrying (inc extraction of petroleum gas),NATURAL GAS,CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION,"Around 13.45 on Thursday 26th August 2021, a suspected hydrocarbon gas release was noted (smell) by a workparty engaged in activity to remove a deck penetration in preparation for further works.  The work party vacated the vicinity and reported their concern to the control room. 

The worksite was adjacent to a known piping anomaly on line 02-DH-37089-CG4, a fuel auto-drain to closed drains line from power generation turbine X-7001-A which is non-hazardous area.

No fixed gas detectors were activated and no executive action occurred. A dynamic risk assessment (with reference to P&ID drawing) of the situation was conducted which indicated that the release could be exacerbated by triggering an automated shutdown and blowdown, due to the release being on the closed drain system that is interconnected with the flare (closed drains pressure floats on the flare Knockout drum pressure). Consequently, manual actions were taken to sequentially close gas sources that could be feeding the release, since the gas dispersion was being carefully monitored and managed. Manual venting to flare and shutdown were managed to minimise flare header pressure.

Barriers were established and portable gas detection maintained at North, East and South spots close to the release site. Operations set up constant monitoring of worksite including %LEL checks upwind and downwind, with the instruction that the CRO would be notified if any gas detectors were to alarm.

A 1mm2 pinhole leak was found on the 12mm small bore tubing impulse line to pressure transmitter PZA-2031.
Pressure in the tubing was 30bar.
The release was calculated as being 0.25kg/min. The time between detection and isolation was more than 4 minutes � therefore the release was more than 1kg and is ROGI reportable.
The release rate was 15kg/hour, meaning that it was above the 3kg/h RIDDOR reportable dangerous occurrence threshold.
There was no detection of gas on the fixed fire and gas system.
Personal gas detectors were worn by the technicians carrying out the survey, no gas was detected.
No executive action was taken.
As a double block and bleed isolation was available, the line was isolated. 
No gas reading was taken at the location of the first release before the isolation as it is at circa 3.5m elevation.
Rope access technicians were deployed to remove and replace the small bore tubing once the line was isolated.

The gas from the vent migrated back towards the platform activating gas detectors in Module One.,At the time of the event the operations team were managing level build up in the HP compressor suction drum. This required manual intervention by means of draining the vessel levels to the closed drains system.,Quarrying (inc extraction of petroleum gas),CRUDE PETROLEUM,CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION,"On the 16th September 2021, at 0310hrs multiple gas detector alarms including a line of sight activated in Module 01 resulting in the change of platform status and 3.1 gas shutdown.

The HP Compressor had been started and there was level build up in the HP compressor suction drum. The levels normally return to the LP Flare header, via the LCV, however there was increasing levels within the HP compressor suction drum and an intervention was required. The decision was made to drain down the HP Compressor Suction Drum fluids into the closed drains system.
Following extensive investigation, it was concluded that the release resulted from NGLs vented via the 18"" atmospheric vent. Natural Gas Liquids were drained from the HP compressor suction drum to a warmer lower pressure system (slop oil vessel) which resulted in a flash off. The slop oil vessel (closed drains) is at atmospheric conditions and is routed to a vent approximately halfway up the west flare.

At 0310hrs the first low level gas head (G9107 � 03:10:53) activated in Module 1, the request was made by the CRO for two nearby technicians to investigate the Low Level gas. As the technicians approached (but did not enter) module 01 from the North stairwell they noted a strong hydrocarbon odour in the air. Moments later additional gas heads activated and a platform
3.1 (gas) shutdown commenced.

- All personnel returned to the TR and proceeded to their primary muster stations.
- All gas heads cleared and reset within 8 minutes
- Full Muster was achieved within 16 minutes
- Emergency Response teams mustered - they were not deployed

The shut down was an ESD-1B (shutdown of process without blowdown) which occurred at 0558 that morning some 7 hours earlier and shut down both Train A and Train B. Preparations were ongoing to re-start the process (on Train A) when the leak occurred on Train B, although the preparations had not yet reached the point of re-introducing hydrocarbons from the wells. Following the introduction of 5.2 barg steam to process Train A, a leak from Train B was reported by outside Process Operators to the CCR.

Train A was being prepared for start-up following the earlier trip and Train B was to remain shut down to carry out some opportunistic remedial work. Steam had been requested to be supplied from the boilers and this allowed steam to be supplied to the seawater heater to allow flushing via the HSPs to warm through the subsea equipment in readiness for opening the wells for the re-introduction of hydrocarbons to the topsides. When the steam supply was established on the topsides it was able to reach the Oil Heater 30-HE-1122 as the shutdown valve, 30B-SDV-5700, on the steam supply to the heater was known to be passing. Steam should not have been present in the oil side of the heater, but was evident when the leak from the oil outlet line was observed to be a mixture of steam and oil. A failure of tubes within the heater would allow the migration of steam into the oil side of the heater. This will be confirmed when the heater has been inspected and tested to ascertain the condition of the tube bundle (preparations ongoing to carry out this work). 

The steam / oil leak mixture was initially blown by the wind across an area of the installation and when the steam leak was stopped (by Marine Engineers venting via the main steam relief valve and then shutting down the supply completely), the oil continued to flow out the flange joint (most probably due to back pressure from the LP Separator) until all the block valves were able to be closed. The oil inlet block valve closest to the Oil Heater could not be closed as the steam leak was orientated on to this valve, so the next valve down the line was closed first (from the Oil/PW Exchanger). The valve the leak was emanating from could not be closed until the leak subsided enough to gain access and when it was closed the leak ceased. The oil had covered an area of the Weather Deck aft of the heater and due to the trim of the vessel had then flowed over the aft edge of the deck and onto support structures and equipment on the Process and Main Decks below. A small quantity made its way into the sea despite efforts to prevent this happening. At no time during the leak was gas detection - either fixed or on individual Operators personal monitors - activated. Prior to the shutdown the process had been running continuously for >70 days since last trip. No indication from the bolted connection of any issues had been noted, i.e. no weep or seep evident.

The start-up sequence was abandoned and the plant was completely shut down and made safe. An immediate containment and clean-up response was initiated with all available personnel deployed to assist. Spill pads, spill bunds and absorbent granules were utilised to contain and prevent further spread of the released oil and minimise the amount lost to sea.  Further cleaning effort will be required due to the extent of the oil spread i.e. on vertical and horizontal members of the module support structures at height at various elevations.

When the bolted connection was inspected it was found that all the studbolts on the flange involved were able to be turned by hand with minimal effort required. ","Direct Cause:
Leak from bolted flange joint connection - loss of bolt tension in joint.

Underlying Causes:
Thermal cycling; vibration; steam hammer; passing steam shutdown valve.","The incident is still under investigation and the following is based on the information available at this time.
Lessons learned: 
Thermal cycling combined with in-service vibration most likely causes of bolts losing tension. This is also probably exacerbated by instances of steam / water hammer in the system affecting the Oil Heater on Train B. 
Location of Train A Oil Heater is different to Train B and is less exposed to environmental conditions than Train B.


Preliminary recommendations:
1. Check bolting of equivalent valve on Train A for tightness. (Completed - minor reduction noted and all bolts re-tightened to design value). 
2. All bolted joints associated with Train A Oil Heater and adjacent pipework to be checked for correct torque values and any necessary remedial work completed prior to start-up.
3. Total steam and production shutdown to be conducted to allow remedial work to be completed. This is currently ongoing (29/10/21)

Using his gas meter, the Technician was able to identify the source of the release as gauge NE-PDIT-22112 block valve manifold on the trains export compressor's seal gas system. The Technician subsequently contacted the control room and his shift supervisor. 

The shift supervisor arrived on site and used his personal gas meter to confirm the leak was greater than the 20%LEL @ 10cm weep and seep limit. Readings of 70%LEL @ 10cm, 35% LEL @ 50cm and 0% LEL @ 80cm, directly in the path of the leak, were noted.

The isolation valve (V8) had been successfully inflow tested, with the pressure having been bled off above and no indications of the valve passing. To facilitate the testing of the upper valve (V4), well bore pressure was being applied / transferred via an equalising loop from below valve V8 into a connection on the riser above the V4 valve, thereby introducing pressure between the downstream side of valve V8 and the injector head stuffing box stripper elements. 

The choke pressure sensor (pressure within the riser) increased up to a value of 1354psi but then showed indications of dropping. The Driller observed this pressure drop and asked via radio if any valve had been opened and was assured (on the radio) that it hadn�t. The Well Services Supervisor was notified and surface lines were checked, with no issues, and the equalizing loop isolated.

The Coiled Tubing (CT) Supervisor was then informed that a leak was occurring from the injector head subsequently the CT Supervisor instructed the CT specialist to increase the pressure applied to the stripper head to contain hydrocarbon release. Leak was stopped and pressure in riser noted as 1175 psi � a reduction of 182psi. The total duration of the release was ~4 minutes. The intervention riser pressure was bled down to zero via the Expro choke and a Time Out For Safety (TOFS) was called with all personnel involved in the operation. Off-shift rig management were informed, a toolbox talk (TBT) was held with all involved personnel capturing lessons from the TOFS as well as a reassessment of the situation before continuing with the operation, which was completed successfully. 

The calculation of gas released is based on the volume of the riser and the drop in pressure before the stuffing box stripper element sealed. This was calculated to be 556 scf of hydrocarbon gas.

What Happened?
When transferring hydrocarbon gas from below valve V8 into the intervention riser in preparation for inflow testing valve V4, gas started to escape past the coiled tubing stuffing box stripper element.

What were the consequences? 
Hydrocarbon gas was released into the atmosphere into a non-hazardous zone above the drill floor wind wall. There was no activation of rig gas alarm systems.

Potential Consequences?
Hydrocarbon emission to environment.
There were no risks of fire, explosion or the potential for personal injury due to the location and extent of leak.

Actual Consequences?
Restricted emission to environment due to area of release being a non-hazardous area, located approximately 30 ft. above the drill floor, the position of involved personnel during this operation (Red Zone Management in place) and timely response by crew onboard.
The release of the 556scf of hydrocarbon gas was minimised by effective vigilance of the crews in identifying the cause of the problem, and affecting the measures to prevent further release. 
Additionally, the equalisation loop was effectively isolated at the kill wing valve (KWV) very quickly, which would have minimised the potential release volume had the pressure not been applied to the stripper element.",Awaiting Classification,0,YES,,GAS,INSIGNIFICANT,,,556 scf of gas,,YES,NO,"556 scf of gas, Equivalent Wt 27.171 lbs, 12.35 kg",KG,,,,,,,Awaiting Classification,0.051,KG/SEC,,,,4,MINS,Stuffing Box on Coil Tubing Injector Head,Drill Floor,Drilling Equipment,Gas,Gas Test,,Risers,Coiled Tubing Units,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UNCLASSIFIED,NATURAL,,Open Air,,"20 knots (10 m wind speed) , 22 knots (50 m wind speed) 24 knots (100 m wind speed)",KNOTS,40� North East,"Gale warning in place.

Upon investigation they identified a ball of ice at flow control valve (FCV-2622)stem packing/gland area of the GC20-2 gas lift line. The SSP was contacted and the area was checked with a portable gas meter. Intermittent readings were observed at 0.1m with zero being recorded at 0.5m. No fixed fire and gas detection initiated. 

Operators proceeded to close the upstream manual valve and downstream riser valve by 17:00 to isolate the line. The cavity was then bled down at 19:49. Extended period between release identification and blowing down of segment of plant was due to requirement to bleed down the pressure either side of the FCV without operating the valve as there was a risk this could have increased the leak rate. Determining the safest way to isolate and bleed down the pressure each side was prolonged due to the complex nature of the piping system. Due to stability in local readings via gas meter the decision was that that bleeding down in a controlled manner was the appropriate action.

Background 
GC2-02 Well has not produced for a number of years, however all its facilities remain operational and a flow trial planned in 2022. The GC gas lift header is used to supply gas lift to all the GF and GC wells via individual flowlines. 

Consequence 

A calculation by Technical Safety assumed a constant rate of release, even although the readings of the gas meter were intermittent. Using a 130 barg pressure, 0.5mm estimated hole size, and 3 hrs 4min duration, the calculated release was 43.03 kg at a release rate of 14 kg/hr.  No personal injury, fire or explosion.

Once the area confirmed as secure by ERTL it was inspected further for source/cause of gas detection with use of FLIR camera. After extensive line walking on each 3 levels of the RAT, no leak point could be identified. Pressure testing was later conducted using nitrogen with no loss of pressure noted.
Based on weather conditions (wind at 12kts from 030) at the time of the event it was determined that most likely source of gas to area would be from the Glycol Regeneration Unit (GRU) vent point located on the Flare Bridge approximately 100m adjacent to the North of the RAT, with no platform infrastructure in between. This vent point releases steam and used stripping gas from the GRU. Data within this ROGI form reflects that of the GRU vent system which is a designed and permitted vent point.
The gas dispersing from the dedicated vent point is captured in this form as an unintentional gas release although it is an intended gas release with unintended consequences, which the form does not cater for.
UPDATE: 
Following further investigation it was determined that the most plausible source of the gas to cause the gas detection on the RAT to be from the Gas Turbine Generator (GTG) vent point, also located on the Flare bridge as per the GRU vent although positioned in going upwards, rather than downwards. Both points are similar distances along the flare bridge. This follows a finding that GTG1 had been stopped approximately 45seconds prior to the gas detection on the RAT.

With the LMV on its integrity test the gas was traced to a leak through W162 LMV bearing cap. Grease was observed oozing from the grease hole in bearing cap at approx. 7 o’clock position.  The leak was measured with a gas meter downwind. Once readings were taken and on completion of the LMV integrity test the valve was moved back to its normal open position and the leak stopped with no detectable level of gas.

Platform fixed systems did not pick up any indication of gas, despite the benign conditions. Any breeze would be removing the gas away from the platform.

ETAP OIM, CRT’s & ETAP PTL were all made aware of findings at the time.

The measured release rate suggests a minor leak consistent with a pinhole rather than a more significant breach.",2,Open pathway,"The gas leak was traced to a specific location (the LMV bearing cap) where gas was escaping, indicating an open pathway for the gas to be released into the atmosphere. The integrity test and subsequent valve operation confirmed that the leak ceased once the valve was returned to its normal position, further supporting this mechanism.",2,Defective equipment,"The leak was traced to the LMV bearing cap, which indicates a failure in the integrity of the equipment itself rather than external factors or operator error. The presence of grease oozing from the bearing cap suggests a malfunction or defect in the component.",2,Inspection/ condition monitoring,"The leak was traced to the LMV bearing cap, indicating a failure in the monitoring of the valve's condition prior to the integrity test.

A vendor is currently on Fulmar, with a view to returning it to service 23 10 20.

During the Nightshift of 13 10 20, as the Nightshift Electrical Tech was carrying out his switchroom checks, he identified that GT 3 had lost its electrical load. He contacted the REP (Offshift) advising him that GT 1 & 2 had taken the load and were close to trip point on �T Max� (Maximum Temperature). 

The REP immediately reported to the HV Switchroom. It was confirmed all GT�s were still running, but GT 3 was only loaded up to 50 � 70 kW and that GT 1 & 2 were at risk of an imminent trip on T Max. If the GT�s were to trip this would result in platform dropping to emergency power only status.

At this point the CRO was instructed by the REP to reduce unnecessary power demand in preparation offloading GT 3. The OTL (Offshift) was notified of the issue and the plan.

As the REP entered the Turbine Hall (U1) he detected the smell of diesel and identified diesel in the South drain gulley at GT 3.

Recognising the potential for escalation, the REP immediately shut down the turbine using the Local Panel Stop and stopped the AC Fuel Pump. He also isolated the electrical supply to the AC and DC fuel pumps using the local lock off switches.

Following successful shutdown of GT3 and isolation of AC/DC Fuel Pump, the REP instructed the CRO to shutdown the PAL system as a precaution, and the OTL and Mechanical Supervisor were contacted and asked to report to the Turbine Hall.

An initial inspection of the turbine enclosure through the window on the North West enclosure door was undertaken by the Mechanical Supervisor. The pressure gauge was easily viewable through the window and was noted to be full of red diesel instead of the normal clear glycerine fluid. There was no evidence of smoke, spray generation but clear evidence of diesel leakage within the turbine enclosure. There was no leakage ongoing at the time as the turbine had been shut down. 

Once it was established that there was no ongoing release within the enclosure, the enclosure door was opened, whereupon it was discovered that the glycerine retaining plug atop the gauge was missing, leaving a 12mm diameter opening.

The area of contamination was limited to structures and equipment below the level of this orifice. All items above this point were found to be free from contamination.

At this stage production was shutdown except for one Free Flowing well and GT 1 & 2 now running well below TMax. As power generation was now considered stable and the platform was in a safe status, attention was now focussed on environmental concerns and the Turbine Hall drains.

It was identified that Diesel had accumulated on the floor of the acoustic enclosure, within the secondary containment Lipped Bund (75mm in height) which surrounds each GT, before flowing via the direct opening into the Turbine Hall North drain filling it, and that there was also some diesel passing from the lipped bund at the south side of the enclosure into the South drain, although this was at a slower rate.

An air operated pump and hand held manual pump was used to pump out the North and South drains. Then soak up pads were scattered to absorb the residues.

Soak up pads were also scattered at NW corner of Turbine hall to soak up the small amount that overflowed from the drain in that area.

6. MOC to be raised to move 98% over fill panel with visual indicators from Telecoms Room to CCR at MCRO position to provide MCRO with instant visual notification of which tank has reached the 98% level.
7. Consider removing high level alarm for the Service Tank on the Rosemount/ABB system thus removing the nuisance alarm in the CCR. Being investigated if this is a Class item",,,,"At 06.15 Hrs on the 1st Feb the MCRO started compiling the Bunkering checklist in preparation for diesel bunkering. On this operation diesel tanks 2 Port and 2 Starboard were selected for the transfer. Tank trends for 2 Port & 2 Starboard were opened on the ABB display in the CCR and the MCRO identified that the display was being identified as ‘Bad’ on 2 Port. The MCRO queried this and was advised that this was normal when the tank had such low levels. The low level within 2 Port was further evidenced when the Engine Room sounded the tanks and 2 Port was 0.05 m and 2 starboard was 3.74 m. The Deck crew connected the bunkering hose to the Bunkering station and the Deck Foreman confirmed that the valves into 2 Port were lined up. Diesel Bunkering then commenced at a reduced rate. The Deck Foreman confirmed the flow of diesel and the supply vessel was instructed to increase the transfer rate. Approx. one hour later the supply vessel reports that they have transferred 177m3, however the MCRO still had no level indication on the ICSS screen for 2 Port. Within 2 minutes of the supply vessel being in contact the MCRO received an audible alarm from the 98% Overfill Alarm Panel and a visual alarm from the Rosemount system which is a level gauging system for Cargo, Ballast and other miscellaneous tanks and is part of the vessels original systems. The MCRO then contacted the Marine Supervisor via the telephone and he advised him that there was a high level alarm activated. The Marine Supervisor then instructed MCRO to check the other ICSS screens to establish the other tank trends but he suspected that this alarm was from the Service Tank in the Engine room which is an alarm that frequently comes in. Due to the high fuel oil consumption on the vessel the Engine room has a constant flow of diesel into the service tank. Within 5 minutes of the discussion between the MCRO and the Marine Supervisor and whilst the MCRO was interrogating the ICSS screens for the other diesel storage tanks the Deck Foreman calls ‘all stop’. The Deck foreman reports to the Marine Control in person and confirms that there has been a spill on the main deck via 1 Port vent line of Approx. 100 litres. The oil spill dump valve, which is in the vicinity of the spill site, was opened and the fluids from the spill were drained down into the Slops tank and the subsequent residual diesel was cleaned up and the area washed up with no spill to sea occurring. To prevent further overspill from the vent due to vessel movement/roll the Marine Engineers transferred 25 m3 from 1 Port diesel storage tank into Settling Tank 2.",Normal production,"The work involved the transfer of diesel fuel from a supply vessel to the storage tanks, which is a routine operation in the normal production process of fuel management on a vessel.",2,Inadequate procedures,"The incident occurred due to a lack of effective procedures for monitoring tank levels and responding to alarms, which led to the failure to prevent the spill during the bunkering operation.

The power tech was called and together they checked for gas by holding up a Quattro personal gas meter to the HVAC exhaust. It alarmed at 10% LEL. The GT was then shut down at 1436 and the fuel gas isolated.

Upon examination there was evidence of liquid/condensate leaking from a failed fuel gas hose (rigid corrugated stainless steel construction with outer braid). The hose was removed from service for inspection where no obvious damage was noted. It was then sent ashore to Score Energy for further inspection to determine failure mode and subsequently to Element for further metallurgical analysis. As the gas release was not picked up on the fixed gas detection system, it was believed that the release was minor. The reports for the hose inspection was only received in the last few days which indicated that the hose condition was worse than previously believed and the investigation was then re-opened.

As the fixed gas detection did not activate, this led to an investigation by the instrument team which highlighted leaks in the aspirator sampling system.

The retaining nut securing the compressor impellor to the shaft had detached from the shaft allowing the shaft to be drawn into the exhaust elbow resulting in loss of the lubricating oil seal. This allowed oil into the exhaust and air inlet manifolds which was ignited by heat from the exhaust gas; approximately 450 - 500 degC. The nut was found lying on the engine skid. It can be assumed that the nut fell onto the beam during the removal of the air filters to investigate the failure of the turbo charger assembly.

Underlying:
Extract from Finning Engineer Report
It was found that the turbine wheel and shaft had detached from the compressor wheel, the securing nut was found on the engine skid on inspection. The inlet snail was removed and inspected, no damage was found on the housing from the compressor wheel. The turbo lines were removed from the turbo and the cartridge removed. It was found that the turbine wheel and shaft was in the exhaust elbow. The threads on the shaft were found to be in good condition and the nut still screws on to the shaft. The turbo bearings were inspected as best as they could and seem to be still in good condition ruling out a bearing failure.
With this evidence the failure looks to be caused by the nut coming off the shaft due to incorrect torqueing or a faulty nut being installed from re man.

Root:
The root cause is inconclusive and to suggest otherwise would be conjecture. The failed cartridge will be sent to caterpillar by Finning for further analysis.
The Turbocharger Cartridges are supplied as a sealed pre-assembled unit and are replaced straight from the packaging; no additional checks are required before installing new cartridges, i.e. rechecking the torque values on the retaining nut. The torque settings of the retaining bolt cannot be re checked in the field as this takes place on a balancing bench, balancing the shaft after torqueing.","Actions Identified:

He checked the area and returned to the control room.  This discovered strange smell was handed over to the oncoming day shift operations team.
A day shift team was sent out to investigate and reported back that there was a reading (1-2% LEL) at the HVAC exhaust of the Solar turbine. Another set of readings were also noted and, using two gas monitors, another positive reading (1-2% LEL) was noted.
The team came back to the Control Room and the General Alarm was initiated to ensure that all personnel were accounted for and within the Temporary refuge (accommodation block).
Another team was sent out to check the readings again from the HVAC exhaust and then to crack open a door to check the inside of the Solar enclosure.
Whilst this was being undertaken, it was noted that the two fixed gas detectors inside the enclosure, (2513 & 2514), were indicating between 1-3.5% LEL.
On this information from the fixed detectors, the team was withdrawn from the PD back to the Control Room and a controlled shutdown of the Solar was undertaken. 
A team then went to the Solar enclosure to carry out visual checks on the fuel gas pipework.  Two �O� rings were changed out.
The unit was started back up on Monday evening.  However, the fixed gas detectors started to read 1-3% LEL again.  The unit was left online with the Operation crew monitoring the levels. Another team went to the enclosure on Tuesday 16th April to execute further on-line running checks.  These were executed and a significant reading was noted on a fitting associated with the pilot fuel ring manifold.
The manifold was taped up to try and corroborate the high LEL reading.  
The unit was taken off-line, and the fitting investigated and remade up.  During these works, another coupling associated with the burner was found to be loose but was not leaking and discounted as the source.
These were repaired / tightened and the unit started up again.  Subsequently, there has been no further weeps picked up by the fixed detectors.

Preparations were underway for the pumping of seawater to the Offtake Tanker to complete the clearance of crude oil from within the floating offloading hose.  During the seawater line up preparations a quantity of Crude Oil was released into the cargo pump room via the bilge pumping system. 

Crude Oil release was from the back flow of Crude Oil from export line/Tank Cleaning Pump into the bilge system, which was estimated to have taken place for approx 15minutes, during the period when pump room valves were being positioned ready to conduct the line clearance.

An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the incident.

At 0924 on 07/07/19, gas detector GSE1014 (cellar deck module X2 vent) came into low gas alarm in the control room which initialed a SD2 as per the asset cause and effects, triggering the SD2. However the GPA did not activate. The C-58 vessel was positively isolated and purged at the time.

Between 0924 & 0925, a total of four gas detectors in module X2 came into alarm(GSE1014, GSE1016, GSE1017 & GSE1013). Each of them are in the vicinity of the vessel and the order in which they came in to alarm is consistent with the expected forced air ventilation path from the module HVAC. The detectors are all set to alarm at >=60% LEL. 

When the SD2 came in, an operator was sent to investigate the gas detection and identified that the C-58 door was open. He noted there were heavy end hydrocarbons entrained in crude oil sludge at the bottom of the vessel which were emitting gas vapours into the module, he therefore immediately closed the door of the vessel and the gas level started to recede (confirmed by the CRO). The OIM was informed but decided that no further emergency response was required at the time as the detectors had reset. The vessel was subsequently purged with nitrogen and later the vessel cleaning scope was resumed.

The initiation of the GPD resulted in a yellow shutdown (full platform shutdown).  GPD 9210 is located on Mod 3 Mezz directly above the condensate system. 

All personnel were promptly accounted for at muster within the temporary refuge within the performance standard.

Upon arrival at the emergency response control room by the platform emergency response team led by the OIM, the detector had reset to 0% LEL, estimated 3 minutes.  Whilst waiting for the platform to blowdown, the fire and gas detection trends were examined and it became apparent that a number of detectors (14), mainly on Mod 3 deck had various readings of gas LEL %.  3 x detectors around the condensate pumps had all had readings above 20% LEL, GDP 9231 @ 43%, GDP 9229 @ 46% and GDP 9230 @ 21%.  

Work parties who had been in the area were consulted, and a fabric maintenance team had highlighted that they observed a gas shimmer on deck level 1, with an adjacent team also smelling gas on the mezzanine level of the same module.

Once the process systems had blown-down and confirmation of no gas readings, the Emergency Response team were deployed to investigate. After thorough investigation, the Emergency Response team had highlighted that there was no obvious or visible signs of a release within the area.

With the all safe given by the OIM, all personnel were stood down from muster and work was suspended external to the accommodation until a full investigation into the leak source had taken place. 

After thorough N2 checks of all process systems with utilisation of FLIR camera, the cause of the leak was presumed as being a damaged stem on a condensate drain valve. The cause of the damage to the stem is being established as part of the investigation. This leak path was also verified by the relevant EnQuest Technical Authority as a credible scenario.

In order to commence plant start up a full leak test was conducted on the export compressor seal oil systems which confirmed at that time that the system was healthy. 

Plant start up commenced on 12th July, at which point a second gas release occurred. Due to the start up assurance process being followed a team of Operations and Instrument Technicians were within the area to monitor the train 1 export compressor start up. The Technicians witnessed the source of the release which was the train 1 export compressor seal oil vent system. 

It is believed that this was a repeat of the event which occurred on the 7th July and the release did not occur from a damaged stem on a condensate drain valve as indicated by the initial investigation.

ROV moved in to close proximity of the well and visually confirmed gas flow from the Wellhead Housing. Bubble watch on deck reported gas plume in the water on the Port Aft side of rig. Initiated shallow gas procedures on the rig. The immediate response followed the rig's shallow gas procedure and 540pptf (10.4ppg) water based kill mud was pumped at high rate whilst rotating string. After ~980bbl pumped, the trend in gas flow from the wellhead was observed to be decreasing. There was no indications of mud returns throughout. Continued pumping 720bbl kill mud with rotation at maximum rate. Reduced flow rate and pumped a further 246bbl of 10.4ppg kill mud until gas returns stopped completely.

The cause was traced to a Low Level gas reading on (SGD-6902) line of sight glass. Two Ops Techs with gas meters were sent to investigate. 
Upon approaching the site and standing underneath the line of site glass the Ops Techs gas detectors picked up gas at around 2% LEL (approx. 15m away from V-2004 sight glass). They walked around the flash gas compressor to the front of the HP compressor and upon doing so the individuals personal gas monitors were reading 36% LEL and crowcon gas reader was reading <40% LEL (approx. 6m away from V-2004 sight glass). The individuals then removed themselves from the area and upon doing so one of the ops techs identified a haze coming from V-2004's sight glass within its casing/lagging.
This was communicated to the CRO/OIM and the decision was made to shut down gas compression and to vent off the hydrocarbon gas.
Once the gas compression was shutdown, a Nitrogen pressure test was completed confirming that V-2004 sight glass was the cause of the release.

� The two lube oil filter systems (LP/MP Comp and Gas Export Comp) have opposite change-over valve arrangements this is because the LP/MP compressor has an approved third party lube oil system fitted whilst the Gas export compressor has a Siemens installed lube oil system. Third party valve position different from Siemens.
� There is no pressure gauge on the filter housing and the vent lines do not have a sight glass that would allow the engineers to see if lube oil is still circulating through the housing.
� This is the first time that the engineers have worked on the Train 2 Gas export compressor lube oil system and they had assumed that it was the same filter housing valve position as the LP/MP Compressor     � The engineers could have switched over the in-active and active filters by moving the change-over valve to the opposite position, this would have stopped the flow of lube oil.
� Lube oil flushing activity captured within the body of a permit that covers a number of activities.
� There is not a specific method statement or procedure for lube oil flushing of either the LP/MP and gas export compressors","1. Lube oil flushing / filter housing change out activities to become separate permitted activities.

On 25 October 2019, loading and storage of condensate was being carried out.

During condensate loading and storage the pressure in the tanks increased due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being liberated from the condensate, as well as increasing liquid volumes in the tanks. 

At the time, the system was designed such that pressure control is provided by venting of the cargo oil tank gas (including inert gas) via a cold vent (cargo tank vent), to a safe location.

On this occasion, the hydrocarbons from the vent activated 4 gas detectors which went into low alarm on the FWD crane and in module 2s.  The levels were detected for a matter of seconds and were not sufficient to initiate an automatic shutdown of the plant.

This system is tied in directly off the Gas compressor disch manifold (export and gas lift) to the turret, and operating at 220 bar.

Obviously it is not good practice to leave valves opened up against an end blank, and operator decided to close these valves.
Soon as the first valve was moved/cracked from 100% open towards closed position, a leak occurred from the body bleed on the valve.
Operator informed CCR on radio that there was a leak from the valve, and at the same time the acoustic leak detector in the area went into alarm.
Also a gas detector in the area showed readings (11%LEL), but below alarm limit (20%LEL).  The operators personal H2S detector did not go in to alarm.  OIM and Prod supv were informed.

Due to issues with radio comms, the operator went into the closed walkway and called CCR on telephone to inform what had happened.

He immediately after returned to the site, and a second operator had arrived to assist.
They closed the valve to 100% closed from the intermediate  position (90%open).
Leak stopped immediately.
This was communicated to CCR, and acoustic sensor and gas detector both dropped off to zero.

Upon first information, the OIM had already instructed CCR to shut down production and initiate blow down.
This was now, based on info that leak had stopped, moderated to shut down and depressurise gas compression and blow down of gas discharge header.

Upon closer investigation, it was found that the body bleed on the valve, was of a rare type consisting of a hex plug with an Allen screw in center, and a 3mm weep hole in the side.

On 11th November during night shift approximately at 03:30 in the morning, indication of low level gas (~30 LEL) detected in the Well bay area noted on the Fire and Gas panel.  

As per operated actions in the master alarm database two area technicians were sent to investigate and found well 28N29 A annulus needle vent valve was open by 1/4 of a turn and venting gas. The investigation found that earlier in the shift an area technician was blowing down Annulus A, believing it was Annulus B. Annulus A vent valve was left open � turn before moving onto the blowdown of Annulus B. 

Platform did not go to GPA as per Fire and Gas Logic design (Note: Nelson gas detectors are set at low level 20% and high level 40%). In addition, there was no gas indicated on either of the technicians personal gas monitors.

Consequence of this incident -  no one injured and no asset damage noted.    

The well was immediately shut-in and the area technicians closed the valve stopping the leak. Based on a conservative technical safety calculations, currently gas release is estimated as up to 22 kg maximum.

Why it happened. 
Causal Factors identified during the investigation:
1. The technician left Annulus A vent valve open to atmosphere. 
2. The venting tie-in port plug (secondary barrier in place for Annulus A vent valve) was missing, creating a leak path to the well bay. 
3. A hydrate formed across the Annulus A vent valve preventing full closure or Annulus A vent valve was stiff, convincing the operator that the valve was closed.
4. Annulus A vent port is in line with Annulus B pressure gauge as per design in the well bay (Performing Influencing Factor)
5. The lighting in the well bay is poor, especially at night (Performing Influencing Factor)
6. Emergency Response - it is common practice on the installation for the CRO to confirm the source a of low gas alarm by sending two area technicians to investigate.

See Section A4 for the investigation recommendations. ",No,"While there is considerable uncertainty over the release rate, even the worst case calculation suggests 0.06 -0.07 kg/s.

2. Short term: to reduce likelihood of operator error resulting in blowing down the wrong annulus immediate action required to colour code and label pressure gauges to corresponding vent ports.
3. Long term: Complete an ALARP demonstration on potential engineering solutions to remove the leak path from the annuli to the well bay. The action involves a phased approach; review any historical information relating to an improved engineered solution, review the existing hazard assessment and update if necessary
4. Replace all plugs on vent valves with plugs with lanyards. This will ensure that the plug remains attached to the valve and they don�t fall through open gratings or can be removed from the area by personnel
5. The Nelson low level and high level alarms are set at 20% LEL & 40% LEL respectively. Conduct a review of the industry literature and define the correct alarm levels for Nelson based on the existing equipment. The output will dictate whether work needs to be done to update the Nelson DCS.
6.  In discussion with Technical Safety come to an agreement on whether alarm levels should be changed. If the risked based decision is to reduce the alarms take the necessary steps to update the hardware and all related procedures.

The decision at this point was to start the standby Stripping Gas Compressor (Alpha) shortly after 17-00hrs.  Methanol is deliberately injected into the SGC during the start-up sequence as a quench.  During the line out of the machine it was noticed the compressor start permissive was being held out by a motor purge fault. Scaffolding was needed to investigate this issue which was requested. Work commenced on both compressors with the view to bring on the first available compressor when available to return to service. 

At approx. 19-30hrs the Bravo Compressor unit fault had been rectified and was being prepared for a restart. 
At approx 19-45hrs GPA was initiated due to a single toxic gas detector in high alarm within the Alpha Stripping Gas Compressor enclosure. Both compressors were offline at the time of the incident.
 
ERT where deployed and a small Methanol leak was initially identified on a breather vent.  This leak stopped once the Methanol injection isolation valves to the skid where isolated. Portable detector readings taken by the ERT teams remained low and the initial toxic gas detector reading had moved from a high reading to a negative reading. Over an extended period other detectors within the compressor housing started to vary however only within the confines of the enclosure. 

A pin hole leak within the enclosure around the gearbox was identified which was confirmed as methanol. Again detection only within the enclosure.

The muster was stood down and restrictions to essential personnel only on all decks imposed. 
Post muster, whilst assessing plan of action a second methanol leak appeared externally on the SGC package from a lube oil pump shaft. This did not initiate a platform GPA and was running from the lube oil tank to the safe open drains catchment point which runs to the SOD caisson. As a precaution, although the compressor suction and discharge compressor valves where closed throughout, the manual blocks were also requested to be closed.

It was clearly understood at this point what had happened and that the methanol volume was limited to boundaries of the compressor isolation so area was monitored in a controlled manner until the leak depleted. Actions then taken to safely clean up the area and recover the Methanol which remained within the Boundaries of the compressor system including the lube Oil tank which it eventually had migrated to.

The work scope progressed on the isolated SBT lines however when identifying the next line, the pipefitter inadvertently slackened off the incorrect fitting and a gas release occurred.

The pipefitter reattached the fitting within an estimated time of under 10 seconds during which time the pressure dropped from 51bar to 3.5bar.

The release was identified by a single Line of Sight gas detector and alarmed in the CCR. A Production Operator was mobilised to the area by which time the alarm had reset.

This practice should reduce the likelihood of breaking into a live/pressurised line.",,,,"In the preparation for the installation of an MSAS valve and Delta V cut over on well B53, 2 x GEG pipefitters, were to conduct the removal of sections of SBT associated to the well. This task was part of a wider scope of upgrading all of the platform wells to Delta V and to remove any redundant SBT. Prior to this incident operations were successfully conducted on 7 other wells with similar upgrades to SBT arrangements completed. The SBT associated to these wells had all been isolated & depressurised. This would also have been the case for B53, however due to a passing valve the PBU test (0.5bar increase over 30minutes) on the gas lift system to tree was unsuccessful, and therefore these lines could not be worked on - this included the line which was ultimately opened. As a result of this, and following discussions between the Area Authority and the Pipefitter Charge hand, the permit description was changed to state that the Gas lift lines were not to be worked on under this permit/ICC. The ICC was put in place, with gas lift valves isolated, and drawings marked up to show the ‘Safe Plant’- which did not include the gas lift system.

This was done under an Isolation Method Statement attached to ICC14666
The Coriolis meter was then planned for replacement.  A local isolation (ICC17440) was put in place within the boundary isolation (ICC14666) to do this task thus complying with SIRPs and limiting inventory.
Pipework was tested prior to breaking of containment and found to contain 10-15% LEL.  This was confirmed using a tank scope type gas detector for detecting hydrocarbons in inert atmospheres
Pipework was tested for benzene and gas again at breaking of containment as per the SIRPs procedure. 
Benzene was found to be 25ppm and there was no detected gas at the break point.  The pipe was left to breathe to allow the benzene to dissipate.

GPA initiated, and platform called to muster and a controlled shutdown of the process commenced - Onshore Duty Manager was advised and the Incident Management Team mobilised.

The main risk from this event was the blow down of the installation so a sea water flush was applied from a remote source to help maintain a liquid seal at the leak source and the installation depressurised in a controlled manner.

Due to the nature of the leak the blow down took place over a longer period of time than normal, as each process system was initiated manually to control the volume and pressure entering the drum.

Once the plant was fully depressurised the team established a higher volume sea water flush to manage the level in the HP flare drum - once this was confirmed the Incident Management Team were stood down at 20:30hrs.

Initial conductor severance process - Abrasive water jet cutting of casing and conductor strings

The reservoirs of all wells drilled from Brae Bravo have been permanently isolated from surface by verified barriers during a plug and abandonment campaign. The conductor removal campaign immediately followed this and is on-going.  The method adopted for conductor severance is abrasive water jet cutting by Claxton Engineering�s SABRE tool. The conductors are being severed above the seabed.  The process involved in cutting the conductors is outlined below. 

Two steps:
1. Fast cut to release tension within inner strings prior to conductor severance
2. Slow cut to sever inner casing strings and conductor prior to recovery to surface

Fast Cut - Air at an pressure of 280psi is pumped into inner casing string via umbilical hose at a rate of ~60 ft�/min, exiting the cutting tool at the Fast cut depth ~501ft MD BRT to de-water the well.

The volume of air will theoretically displace the water column inside the 9-5/8� casing above the Fast cut depth to the wellhead in less than 3 minutes. The hydrostatic pressure at the Fast cut depth is 177psi.

Displaced fluid is discharged from two points in the proving string; at the diffuser and at the top of the string at the drill floor

On completion of de-watering, water and garnet slurry is pumped down the umbilical to the cutting tool to perform a �blow through� that cuts a hole through all of the casing strings and conductor to the sea (5� oscillation at 1�/min), creating a communication path.

Slow cut � SABRE cutting tool repositioned -1ft above Fast cut. Packer set to prevent flow up the proving string.

Air at a pressure of 300psi is pumped into inner casing string via umbilical hose below packer at a rate of 200 ft�/min, exiting the SABRE cutting tool at the Slow cut depth 500ft MD BRT to maintain an air cushion at cutting depth.

Water and garnet slurry introduced to perform Slow cut, rotation speed adjusted to ensure complete severance of casing and conductor string.

B25 Event Summary:
On Sunday 8th July 2018, operations to cut the casing and conductor of well B25 commenced with the blow through. A vapour/mist was witnessed discharging from the top of the proving string at the drill floor coincident with a gas alarm in Module 22 between 00:00 and 00:30 hours. Operations were shut down, annulus gauges checked for pressure and the sea surface observed for indications of bubbling or contamination; none were evident. After purging the casing with air at a low rate followed by water, fast cut operations recommenced.

A local gas test was conducted during suspension of the fast cut at shift change between 05:45 and 06:30, with no gas recorded. Fast cut operations recommenced from 224� to 360� when oily water was observed discharging from the diffuser joint, diffuser drain hoses in the well bay and from the top of the proving string at the drill floor.

At 06:56 local module alarms activated in Modules 1, 2, 12 & 22 caused by activation of gas detectors G9745 on the drill floor and G9015 in Module 01.  Operations were shut down while discussions were held with the onshore team. 

The source for the triggering of the alarms was identified as hydrocarbons discharged from top of the proving string on the drill floor and via the diffuser vent situated below the Skid Deck, above the well heads in Module 01 carried in the fluid and air returns associated with the abrasive water jet cutting. Both discharge points are open to atmosphere by design.

The two gas detectors which activated are both in close proximity to the topsides release locations (top of proving string M22 and diffuser joint M01), thus were activated by the coincidental releases which occurred at these locations. 

At 07:26 the CCR received a telephone call regarding a slick on the sea surface at the north east side of the platform.  The Drilling Department confirmed that the release to sea was from the diffuser discharge hoses which were positioned below the +9m guide, directly under B25.  The majority of the release occurred from this location. The release then subsided to form a sheen on the sea.   

The standby vessel took water samples and undertook a BONN calculation.   This calculation estimated a quantity of 0.92 tonnes discharged.   A PON 1 was submitted to BEIS (updates sent to them are given below).

The ROV was launched at 10:30 after the crew�s rest period and confirmed a seep of black liquid hydrocarbons emanating from the cut in the conductor at the cut depth of 501ft below the rotary table. 

Note: To date 16 conductors of the 28 well campaign have been severed without any recorded HC release, four of which have a history of B-annulus pressure.

UPDATES PROVIDED TO BEIS VIA PON1:
Update 9/7/18 - Sea surface is clear of oil from this morning and the ROV has confirmed that the release from the conductor cut has stopped.  Drilling Department are assessing feasibility of recovering any further oil trapped in the conductor string before recommencing cutting operations. 

Update 10/07/18 - Release remains stopped. Onshore team assessing options for recovering any residual oil from conductor string.

An oil recovery procedure was developed by the Drilling Department and a formal risk assessment was undertaken by the Technical Safety Department prior to restarting operations. 

Update 11/7/18 - Oil release remains stopped over past 24hrs. Oil recovery to topsides commenced and is progressing well.

Update 12/7/18 - Operations recommenced with no further spill.

This new tested valves are received by the maintenance team who fitted it on the 27/08/2018 on permit 378477 and completed 16:04hrs.

Overnight a N2 pressure test was was attempted under permit 378480. However the work party utilized the fuel gas vent line as the injection point instead of the transmitter as they could not close the vent valve XY 3244 whilst the unit was offline (Fail open valve), aiming to achieve a test pressure of 40 bar.

The re-instatement test attached to the permit, instructed the team to test at 5 bar, hold the pressure and check for leaks. The operators failed to do this 5bar hold and only completed an initial 10 bar hold test (25% of final test pressure).
However when testing the night shift could not achieve higher than 10 bar, indicating there was a leak (internal or external). The night shift repeated the test 3 times and achieved the same result on each test and each time, they tested the affected joints and no leaks were noted. The night shift suspected there was an internal leak on the FCV and the N2 was entering the turbine through the burners; they had not identified the leak escaping from the missing external sensing port. 
When leak testing was carried out, the team was standing next to the PCV but, the external sensing port is pointing away from the team in the direction of a plate approximately 0.5mtrs away. Their morning report states  �Unable to complete on-skid fuel gas reinstatement test using Nitrogen. Main Fuel Gas FCV-3240 passing N2 into the Burners & unable to build up pressure�.
The OIM did not give authorization to introduce product following this failed pressure test, and the team assumed that it would be OK to introduce hydrocarbons as a 10 bar test and ""snooping"" of the broken joints did not give any cause for concern.

The unit vented approximately 2seconds after requesting the unit to be shut down � this was due to the gas detector inside the unit detecting gas and not the emergency stop.

Underlying Causes: Lack of management system control","The incident is still under investigation and the following is based on the information available at this time.
Administration and management of Control of Work, in this instance, failed to prevent the task from proceeding with all controls and verifications in place.  The permit was issued to the IP without the necessary checks being carried out to ensure that all the controls necessary had been implemented prior to work commencing. There were shortcomings in how the system was isolated and the isolations were checked prior to the breaking of containment, which contributed to the hydrocarbon release. 

Preliminary recommendations:
All core crew and long-term vendor personnel who are users of the Permit to Work system are re-validating their training in the use of the system, regardless of when they last completed training. Status - In progress.
All personnel with specific responsibilities and who are signatories in the issue of permits will have their understanding of their roles and responsibilities within the system reinforced upon completion of Permit to Work system training. Status - in progress.
An independent gap analysis and audit of the Permit to Work Manual and the Mechanical Isolation and Reinstatement of Plant 
Manual is being undertaken by our Process Technical Authority. Status - in progress and offshore visit confirmed for 8th - 13th November for audit.
Work permit audits have been increased (Permit to Work manual states 5% of issued permits - now 10% of issued permits). Status - in progress.

No other work activities were being carried out apart from the operations technicians draining liquids from the vessels prior to initiation of an ESD and blow down.,QUARRYING (INC EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM GAS),NATURAL GAS,NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION,"Inde annual shutdown was planned to start on 22-11-2018 at 06:00. Prior to commencing the shutdown it is a requirement to drain down all liquid levels.  This is to minimise the potential for residual hydrocarbon liquids to flash of following the N2 purging and enable breaking of containment.

Compression had been shut down the previous night and the platform free flowed until 22:00 on 21st when Bacton compression was shut in as part of their planned cool down and outage.  Using plant pressure several Inde 23A pre shutdown activities were being carried out one of which is to reduce all hydrocarbon liquid levels to a minimum and establish gas break through.  

During the evening of 21st the night shift continued to drain down liquids and prepare the platform for the shutdown.

At 05:30 on 22nd a TBT was carried out in the AQCR with all personnel to be involved in the planned shutdown, while this TBT was being carried out one of the operations team was draining the remaining liquids from the suction scrubbers into the 3 phase separator and out of the 3 phase separator into the closed drains tank T4001.  This was being done by manually driving the PCV from the suction scrubbers to the open position and operating BV183 (1 �� ball valve) on the 3 phase separator water outlet to the 4� closed drains header. 

At approximately 05:48 after the TBT in the AQCR had been completed and the technicians were about to deploy to their designated areas the outside operator called in to the AQCR and informed the CRO that gas was leaking from a drain line. 

The operator in attendance then shut in a previously opened valve which immediately halted the leak. This was performed within 15 seconds. 

C Elliston (OIM) visited the AT platform and met with the outside operator and investigated the cause of the leak. It was clearly apparent that the leak was due to an integrity failure on a 1 � Lokring elbow located on the 3 phase separator water outlet manual drain point to the 4� closed drains header.

Once all personnel we in place the call was made to activate AT-GB-01-01initiating a shut down and blow down as per the planned annual shutdown routine.

At the time of the incident no gas detection came into alarm. Initial calculations indicate 0.575 kg of gas was lost although this may be conservative.

An investigation was commenced initially on the platform then by attendance of an HSE advisor to collect photos, witness statements etc. A formal investigation team has been appointed. Perenco are in contact with our HSE inspector in Norwich to keep him appraised of progress (Nick Dickety).

The machine was then shut down. It was noticed that a small volume of the leaking fluid had contacted the adjacent hot turbine exhaust, located 4-5m below the crane, with a small flame observed at a gap in a seam of the cladding. The flame was quickly extinguished by the deck crew and the area doused to displace any residual oil. Exhaust line is located at height above the skid deck. The liquid was determined to be hydraulic oil from the crane engine compartment. Approximately 140litres of hydraulic oil was estimated to have been released based on the oil tank level. The majority of the oil spilled was found contained within the compartment with some leaking down the crane pedestal to the Upper Production Deck.

",NO,NO,NO,,"The cause of the gas release was the 2� coiled tubing splitting at the Coil tubing connector. This was caused by the bottom hole assembly (BHA) (which is not flexible) trying to go around the goose neck of the injector head. This was caused by the BHA passing through the Stripper Brass bushings. The Brass bushings should be a smaller ID than the BHA OD in order to prevent this, however these were found to be worn.","Initial investigation identified three contributing factors to the incident:  1. Wear to the stripper brass bushings meant to prevent the Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) from being pulled up into the injector head and the �goose neck�. The wear to the inner diameter (ID) was sufficient to allow the BHA to pass through.
2. Depth gauge error. The Coil Tubing (CT) Operator believed that the BHA was lower than it actually was due to an error in the depth measurement provided by the CT reel shaft encoders.
3. The CT Operator was experiencing fluctuations in the operation of the CT reel which gave him variable �load indications� making it more difficult to identify the load reading at the time that the BHA arrived at the stripper brass bushings.

Preliminary Recommendations to prevent re-occurrence:
1. Replace stripper brass bushings. (Completed).
2. Inspect the stripper brass bushings after each run in hole and confirm they are still fit for purpose.
3. Re-set CT Reel depth gauge shaft encoders (2 off) and function test at surface to confirm that they are aligned. Continuous monitoring throughout the program. Completed).
4. Re-position depth depth gauge displays on the CT operators screen to improve visual correlation between the two. (Completed).
5. Carry out vendor inspection of the CT reel systems to identify potential cause(s) of the fluctuations experienced by the CT operator. (Completed). Two faults have been found and rectified. A crossover PSV was found to be lifting early, thereby reducing available hydraulic pressure, and a sequence valve was found to be set above it�s operating pressure of 300 psi. Both have now been corrected and function tested. In addition a new charge pump (hydraulic) has been fitted to the CT power pack as a precaution.

Whilst topping up, a loss of containment occurred at the bell nipple resulting in a gas, oil & brine being released with spillage to deck and subsequently to the sea. The total volume of the spill was estimated to be approximately 4bbls, of which some of the fluids dripped down 4 levels of grating and into the sea. The majority of the spill was contained within solid deck and crash matting on the skid deck. Based on Sheen size an initial calculation of 14 litres spill to sea was estimated. The volume of gas is currently being calculated. The Well Gear power pack shut down after the initial release due to gas detection safety shut-down (Sensors are set for 10% LEL). The immediate action taken was to close in the well as per the agreed and practiced well control plan. The full open safety valve (FOSV) and BOP annular preventer were closed. Initial shut in pressure was 0 psi. This increased over a 12 hr period to 40 psi. The well was then bled back to 0 psi and fluid circulated around the well. Following a static flow check, the fishing string was stripped in hole. Once the area was made safe, spill kits were used to cover the affected areas on the skid deck, wellheads and cellar deck with efforts made to cover gratings and prevent fluid being spilled to sea.

Whilst topping up, a loss of containment occurred at the bell nipple resulting in a gas, oil & brine spillage to deck and subsequently to the sea. The total volume of the spill was estimated to be approximately 4bbls, of which some of the fluids dripped down 4 levels of grating and into sea. The majority of the spill was contained within solid deck and crash matting on the skid deck. Based on Sheen size an initial calculation of 14 litres spill to sea was estimated. The volume of gas is being calculated.  The Well Gear power pack shut down after the initial release due to gas detection safety shut-down (Sensors are set for 10% LEL).  The immediate action taken was to close in the well as per the agreed and practiced well control plan. The full open safety valve (FOSV) and BOP annular preventer were closed. Initial shut in pressure was 0 psi. This increased over a 12 hr period to 40 psi. The well was then bled back to 0 psi and fluid circulated around the well. Following a static flow check, the fishing string was stripped in hole. 
Once the area was made safe, spill kits were used to cover the affected areas on the skid deck, wellheads and cellar deck with efforts made to cover gratings and prevent fluid being spilled to sea.

Inspection data is available and preliminary investigations reveal that the inspector deemed the spool to be in adequate condition.  An investigation team has been established and the expectation is that the investigation team will establish the facts and provide recommendations by 14/6/17.  Following an investigation and completed Incident review Panel (IRP)  the findings are as follows: 
Immediate Cause - There was a total failure of integrity of 8""-F-10012-HA2D.  The pipework had failed due to crevice corrosion localised to the pipe support at TP-113.  Underlying Causes � Through-out the inspection history of this line excessive pipework movement and vibration has referenced multiple features (including TP-113) across multiple reports.  This pipe work movement will have exacerbated the wall loss in this area. 
� An earlier MCDR raised against the failed line (for FM and movement) was closed with incorrect justification for both damage mechanisms. 
Root Cause - During the 2015 Inspection activity, the failure point (TP-113) was reported as having 3mm scale height.  From the report, the reported defect was significantly higher than 3mm and closer to 12mm.  This should�ve been the trigger for an MCDR escalation and Integrity review. � This misreporting was subsequently not picked up during the inspection report review cycle.  Anomaly underestimation is also apparent on other features contained within this report e.g. TP-126. � Any MCDR raised at this point would certainly have led to further CUPS inspection and relevant mitigation. 
  ","A desktop review has been requested of all features that were inspected during this campaign in 2015 to establish whether there was a a broader issue.  The line was further inspected and fabric maintenance completed on another feature however the wall thickness here was within tolerance.  More photographic evidence of the incident failure prior to the operations reaction of draining would have helped quantify the quantity spilled and original hole size.  Following an investigation, the follow actions are to be addressed, these actions will be raised and tracked in  Shells Fountain Incident Management system:  1 Continue with Curlew Inspection reporting data review.

The vessel was in the process of having positive isolations applied to allow Confined Space Entry. Two spec blinds on the bottom of the vessel had already been swung and a third flange had been broken. The final flange containing SB 40109 had been broken by the operations technician on day shift to take benzene readings and drain out fluid (water). The process of draining fluid and taking readings was ongoing into nightshift. This was taking place via a small scaffolding access tower. At a certain point the Operations Technician was confident that the vessel was empty. As a precaution the Vendor Operator working on the joint was instructed to don a slicker suit and mask, and drip tray was prepared. After the spec blind was removed a blockage of sand/debris gave way to some liquid and a quantity of oil poured out. The Operations Technician instructed the Vendor Operator to come down from the scaffolding, out of the way from the oil that drained from the line. The oil was left to drain from the line to the deck. The oil filled an area on the deck of circa 11x8m. The cellar deck is of solid construction. The volume released was estimated to 100 litres based on the volume of the line. Emergency spill kits were immediately deployed to contain the oil and the area was barriered off.

1. Rectify faults with level instrumentation on 30-VG-1615.
2. PW Degasser Oil pump in Trains A and B are auto started based on a liquid level in the vessel. Start the pumps once there is a healthy level in the PW Degasser and maintain the pump on continuous recycle, with flow forward once the level in the vessel reaches a pre-determined set-point.
3.  Ensure the globe valve travel on CFU is mechanically limited to prevent rapid filling of the PW Degasser i.e. ensure inflow from the CFU oily water reject line is not greater than outflow of the PW Degasser Oil pumps.
4. Alarm management, rationalisation and prioritisation to be added to priority list for optimised production uptime.

The sealing face of the diaphragm gasket was found to not be in the correct sealing position as a segment of approximately 10% of the circumference was not correctly seated. 
 
Underlying cause:-This valve has been in operation and holding pressure since it was installed in August 2017, and has not been disturbed since then.  
For the diaphragm gasket to be in the position it was found it is believed that either of two things have occurred:- 
1. The first explanation for this seal to fail is that the diaphragm gasket was inadvertently incorrectly fitted by the manufacturer when assembling the PCV.  
2. The second explanation for this seal to fail is it would seem that when stopping and starting gas export, the valve is exposed to significant pressure and temperature variations which theoretically has caused rapid expansion/contraction of the components and therefore being different components then different rates of expansion/contraction, along with the fact that the diaphragm was not fitted correctly and not covering the whole sealing surface then this is the most likely explanation for why the valve which had not been leaking before now leaked as Gas Export was re-started after 4 days shutdown. By design, the diaphragm gasket will be exposed to significant pressure and temp variations when the system is started up.  
","1. The leaking PCV valve has been replaced by a brand new valve of the same type.

2 - Identify how many of these valves we have on board and check them for leak by HC sniffing and snoopy tests. 
 
3 - Operating Procedure for the analyser house will be amended to include that the gas feed to the analyser house will now be closed off when export compressor is stopped as the analyser measurements are then not required at this point.  At start of export compressor & before start exporting gas, a start-up check list procedure will be implemented for the analyser house, in which checking and closely monitoring for leaks shall be done until steady state conditions (i.e. pressure & temperatures) have been reached for the analyser house. 

4 - Awareness of most effective immediate response action to a low level gas alarm inside the analyser house has been raised among the production team.   Manual shut off valves which will stop the gas feed into the analyser house have been clearly marked in the field and shall be used without entering the house. After these valves have been closed the remaining gas volume in the downstream tubing and equipment is 0.062 Nm3.

The area of initial smell was further investigated which revealed that no fixed point or acoustic gas detectors had been activated.  Further checks (using gas monitors) could not detect a gas release, only a smell of gas could be detected when stood high up on the scaffold used for the painting activity, which eventually dissipated. Further checks by the outside operator of the day were carried out on 26th November. With the wind direction now slightly altered there was still no apparent gas smell evident. The area was searched using fixed platforms & existing scaffolds, but  nothing could be found.

An extended long length of instrument tubing connected to a portable gas detector was used in an attempt to search the high overhead pipe runs. Here a reading 3% LEL was achieved.

The standby pump came on line as intended as was capable of providing firewater coverage if the demand had been genuine. 

Shortly afterwards, a fire detector alarm (FD-632601-1) annunciated in the ICSS and cleared a short time later.

The diesel spill on the deck was notified by the barge operator who immediately asked for all diesel transfer operations to be shutdown. Following this spill kits were deployed to contain the spill and clean up commenced with the installation trimmed aft to keep the spill inboard.  However it was subsequently established that the stores deck hatch adjacent to the day tank vent location had a drain to sea and this provided the route for the majority of the spilled volume to be lost overboard.

The loss of diesel was traced to a small bore pipe fitting on the main fuel line to the turbine.  No entry is permitted into the Turbine hood enclosure while it is running.  To allow isolation of the fuel line a full shutdown and depressurisation of the gas compression system was initiated.  Isolation of the diesel fuel system was undertaken.  The liquid was contained in the bunded area beneath the turbine.  Measurements were taken to establish the quantity lost and the bund was pumped out.  During the outage, maintenance activities has been undertaken on the diesel fuel system, however the fitting that leaked was not part of the work scope undertaken.",Normal production,"The work being performed is routine operational checks and monitoring of the turbine, which aligns with normal production activities. The incident described occurred during these routine checks, indicating that normal production was ongoing.",2,Inadequate maintenance,"The leak occurred from a fitting on the main fuel line, which was not part of the maintenance work scope undertaken during the outage, indicating a lack of thoroughness in the maintenance activities.

This aligns with the definition of an open pathway where a substance can flow out of its intended containment.",2,Defective equipment,"The leak was traced to a small bore pipe fitting on the main fuel line, indicating a failure in the equipment rather than an external factor or operator error. The maintenance activities did not address this specific fitting, suggesting it was defective or had degraded over time.",2,Isolation,"The leak was traced to a small bore pipe fitting on the main fuel line, indicating that proper isolation procedures may not have been effectively implemented during maintenance activities.

","Operations suspected that there could be residual condensate lying in the flowline and/or the metering orifice box, and the Permit to Work should have highlighted this as a specific hazard, with stronger mitigations in place to prevent any problems, including better communications between Operations and the Metering Technician. Operations should have been on site to control subsequent break of containment.  ",,,,"A Metering Technician had been issued with a Permit to Work which allowed him to replace a flow orifice under formal isolation. An Operations Technician was on site for the initial Break of Containment and the old orifice plate was removed. Prior to going for lunch the Metering Tech closed the shutter on the orifice carrier. On returning from lunch the Metering Tech was on his own and re-opened the orifice carrier and a quantity of hydrocarbon gas was emitted from the carrier and activated the Line Of Site gas detector approx 3m above the worksite. This initiated a General Platform Alarm, Surface Process Shutdown and an Installation auto-depressurisation. On change of status the Metering Tech reported to his Muster Point and highlighted that a relatively small quantity of gas had been released when he re-opened the orifice carrier, which was a significant help to the response. The Installation POB mustered as per procedure and the process inventory vented as per design. When it was safe to do so, members of the ERT Team checked the worksite and confirmed that it was safe to re-instate integrity to the orifice box. Personnel were then stood down from Muster and an investigation commenced.",Maintenance,"The work involved replacing a flow orifice, which is a typical maintenance activity to ensure proper functioning of the system.

",NO,NO,NO,,"Direct Cause: Manual venting of Crude Oil Tanks (via the vent header and flame arrestor terminating above the turret area) in low ambient wind conditions resulted in hydrocarbon gas detection in the turret area.
Underlying Causes- Manual venting in marginal wind conditions with decreasing wind speed over the duration of venting.  Reduced monitoring of reducing wind speed conditions during shift handover period.  Design of flame arrestor at vent point does not create a high velocity plume.
",Review of operating procedure to provide clearer guidance during specific wind and operating conditions.  Reinforce requirements of operating procedure with operational and marine teams,,,,"A planned task to vent and reduce tank pressures of the Crude Oil Tanks was ongoing during nightshift, this operation was to allow isolation of the PV breaker which had released on the 1st. This would allow the PV breaker to be returned to the required SG (specific levels) prior to any re-start of process plant. The tank in-line PV breaker valves were opened up one at a time; this was coordinated with the MCRO in the CCR monitoring the tank pressures to allow a controlled release of the tank pressure while communicating with the Pumpman at each location. The vent path for this operation is up to the turret roof where the tank pressure is vented to atmosphere. The venting procedure requires wind conditions to be closely monitored throughout the task; the MCRO was monitoring this throughout the task. At 06:04 the MCRO requested that the tank currently being vented to be closed back in as the wind speed was decreasing significantly. At 06:06 the GPA activated following F&G indication initially from x2 detectors in the PW degasser Level 1 area with a Fire Zone 73 detection trip initiating shortly afterwards, there was further F&G activation on the Flare KO drum Fire Zone 84 detection. Additional F&G detection initiated within the turret area and the forward fire pump room inlet. The tank valve was confirmed close and the Pumpman reported to his muster point. All personnel were accounted for and the F&G indications began to clear at 06:30. All personnel were stood down from muster points at 06:43 following a confirmatory check by the ERT wearing BA that no gas remained in the affected areas.

This is a standard procedure in the normal production cycle to ensure equipment is functioning correctly and safely.,2,Inadequate procedures,"The incident involved multiple detector activations indicating a gas cloud, suggesting that the venting procedures may not have adequately accounted for wind conditions or the potential for gas accumulation.

Release of diesel supply within small bore tubing within diesel generator.",Start-up/reinstatement,"The work involves the commissioning phase leading up to the introduction of hydrocarbons, which aligns with start-up activities. The sequence of events indicates a response to a shutdown and subsequent reinstatement of power and operations.",2,Inadequate procedures,"The sequence of events indicates that while emergency protocols were activated, the initial heat generation and subsequent flame indication suggest that procedures for monitoring and responding to such conditions may not have been adequately followed or designed. The ignition of diesel spray points to potential procedural gaps in managing fuel systems during commissioning phases.",1,Small bore piping,"The release of diesel was specifically noted to occur within small bore tubing associated with the diesel generator, indicating a localized failure in that section of the piping system.",2,Split,"The release of diesel occurred within small bore tubing, which typically suggests a failure that could be characterized as a split rather than a crack or pinhole. The significant volume of diesel released over time indicates a more substantial breach than a pinhole would suggest.",1,Open pathway,"The release of diesel occurred within small bore tubing of the diesel generator, indicating that there was an open pathway for the fuel to escape. The ignition of the diesel spray suggests that the containment was compromised, allowing for the release to occur.",2,Defective equipment,The release of diesel from small bore tubing within the diesel generator suggests a failure in the equipment that was supposed to contain the fuel. This indicates that the equipment may have had a defect that led to the release.,1,Isolation,"The failure to isolate the fuel supply in a timely manner contributed to the ignition of the diesel spray, indicating a lapse in the isolation safeguards. The sequence of events shows that isolation was only confirmed after the fire had already been triggered, suggesting a failure in the isolation process.",2
